# GRAPHR v0.1.0
An HR administration system outline using **Neo4j Aura** in the backend

## INSTALLATION

- have ```Python 3.9``` installed
- clone the repository
- ```cd``` to the repo and run ```python3 -m venv .venv```, then ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- in the virtual environment, run ```pip install .``` (make sure you are where ```setup.py``` is)
- after installation, run ```graphr -h``` and supply your environment with the variables needed

### Notes
- this is a crash, 2-day miniproject
- the point was to deliver ASAP, therefore Flask was chosen as a framework

### Acknowledgments
- the code is hacked and is far from optimal
- the error handling is a joke

### Might be added yet
- more data and queries for the structure overview
- more nodes attributes
- more relationships, adding ```datetime``` attribute to the relationships allowing for more interesting queries
